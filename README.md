### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com" rel="me">Chris Hammond</a>

#### About Me
I live in Wildwood, Missouri and I like to build things. I've got sites all over the internet, but the best place to read more about me is likely [over on About Chris Hammond](https://www.chrishammond.com/about)

#### Other Things
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m building things, primarily using #Astro ~~Jekyll~~ these days
- ðŸ“· I am the photographer behind [RainbowMarks Photography](https://rainbowmarks.com)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@christoc](https://bsky.app/christoc) on BlueSky
- âš¡ Fun fact: I collect domain names and hobbies.... 

#### Past Things
- DNN is how everything started for me. Okay, maybe not everything, but I am what I am because of that platform and all that it brought me, from technical knowledge, to friends.
- Netduino was something I dabbled in a bit, over a decade ago now (what?)
- Cars are still a big part, so not sure why I list them as PAST here.
