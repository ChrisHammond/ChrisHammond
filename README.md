- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@christoc](https://twitter.com/christoc) on Twitter (~~x~~)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I collect domain names and hobbies.... 

#### Past Things
- DNN is how everything started for me. Okay, maybe not everything, but I am what I am because of that platform and all that it brought me, from technical knowledge, to friends.
- Netduino was something I dabbled in a bit, over a decade ago now (what?)
- Cars are still a big part, so not sure why I list them as PAST here.
